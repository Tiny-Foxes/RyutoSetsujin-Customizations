# RyutoSetsujin-Customizations
Customization things by Ryuto Setsujin can be found here.

If you ever stream on Twitch using my customizations, and if you're in the Project Moondance Discord, feel free to ping me @Ryuto Setsujin#1116! I'd love to see my customizations in action!

## Things to note:
Popira NoteSkin: Reverse is HIGHLY recommended, as the noteskin will not work properly otherwise.
